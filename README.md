The Monty Hall Problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. Imagine you're a contestant on a game show, and there are three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats (which you don't want).

Here's how it works:

1. You choose one door, say Door 1.
2. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what’s behind each door, then opens one of the other two doors, say Door 3, revealing a goat.
3. Now, you have a choice: stick with your original choice (Door 1) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door 2).

The counterintuitive part of the problem is that you actually have a better chance of winning the car if you switch doors. When you first choose a door, you have a 1/3 chance of picking the car and a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. After Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, if you switch, your chances of winning the car increase to 2/3, while sticking with your original choice keeps your chances at 1/3.

So, the best strategy is to always switch! It’s a great example of how our intuitions about probability can sometimes lead us astray.
